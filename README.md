## Inferential Statistics for Data Scientists

  Inferential study of a medical dataset regarding 2.500 newborns of 3 different hospitals, containing parameters related to mothers (age, smoker/non smoker, number of     previous pregnancies, etc.) and infants (sex, weight, length, skull diameter, etc.). 
   (e.g. does a mother who smokes have a higher probability to give birth to an underweight baby?).
  
  The projects consists in the developments of the following points:
  
  
  * _Brief descriptive analysis of the dataset variables;_
  
  * _Use of different types of tests (t, wicoxon, shapiro, chi squared, etc.) to test several hypothesis, such as: "are infants' weight and lenght significantly different from the population?", "are the amounts of cesarean births significantly different among hospitals?", "are there some variables significantly different between sex?" and so on;_
  
  * _Creation of multiple linear regression models to predict newborns' weight as a function of mother's and other newborn's characteristics, evaluating which is the most accurate._
